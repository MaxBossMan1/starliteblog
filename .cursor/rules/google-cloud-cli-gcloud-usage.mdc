Rule:
Always set the correct project context with gcloud config set project [PROJECT_ID] before running commands.
Use gcloud auth application-default login for local development authentication.
When creating Cloud SQL instances, use PostgreSQL 15 to match the project database standard.
Always check instance status with gcloud sql instances describe [INSTANCE_NAME] before connecting.
Use explicit region specifications (e.g., --region=us-central1) for all resources to maintain consistency.

For Cloud SQL access, prefer Cloud SQL Auth Proxy over direct IP authorization for security.

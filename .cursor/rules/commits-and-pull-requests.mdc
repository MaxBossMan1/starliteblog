Rule:
Write commit messages in present tense and clearly describe the change (e.g., “Add user authentication endpoint”).
Reference related issue numbers in pull requests (e.g., “Fixes #42”).
All changes must be submitted via pull requests—never merge directly to the main branch.
Wait for Bugbot to review and process each pull request before merging.

Do not bypass Bugbot checks or force-merge PRs unless absolutely necessary and approved.

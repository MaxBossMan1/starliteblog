Rule:
Use Prettier and ESLint for formatting and linting all JavaScript/TypeScript code.
Always run linting and formatting before committing code.
Prefer async/await for asynchronous operations; avoid callbacks and .then() chains.

Use TypeScript types and interfaces for all function signatures and data structures.

Rule:
Always check items off in development-checklist.md as they are completed.
Before starting new features, verify all prerequisite checklist items are completed.
For database-related work, ensure "Set up Google Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL)" is marked complete before proceeding with deployment items.
Update the "Current Status" section at the bottom of the checklist after major milestones.
Follow the phase order: complete Phase 1 items before starting Phase 2.

Test each checklist item thoroughly before marking as complete.
